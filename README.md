2. Get Your API Key
This application requires an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch data.

Create an account on OpenWeatherMap.
Navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new key.
3. Configure the Application
Open the weather.html file in your preferred code editor. You will need to replace the placeholder API key in the JavaScript section with your actual key.

Locate the following lines (or similar) in your <script> tag and update the apiKey:

// Replace THIS_IS_YOUR_API_KEY with the key you generated from OpenWeatherMap
const apiKey = "THIS_IS_YOUR_API_KEY";
const apiUrl = "[https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather)?...";

4. Run Locally
Simply open the weather.html file in your web browser.
